# Focused Search and Evidence

Read this when a changed contract, historical decision or unexpected dependency needs deeper investigation. Start from the question to resolve and stop once its answer is supported.

## Current facts and target decisions

For claims about existing behavior, prefer observed runtime behavior and source/schema/configuration from the relevant revision, corroborated by tests and callers. An executed test supports the tested path; reading a test establishes only its intended assertion. Identify deployed versus local revisions when they differ.

Use the user's accepted requirement/design to decide target behavior. Distinguish an intentional before/after change from a stale description or an unexplained implementation conflict. Neither old code nor an old test automatically creates a compatibility requirement.

## Trace the affected path

```text
caller -> entrypoint -> validation -> changed branches -> downstream/storage
       <- result/error mapping <- retry, cancellation or partial failure
```

Check only the edges relevant to the change: field types and optionality, identity and tenant boundaries, defaults, persistence, retries, ordering, configuration and limits. Inspect both sides of a changed interface where available. Follow the source IDL/schema and regeneration path when generated clients are involved.

Start with exact symbols/config keys and local aliases using `rg -F`. Use regex after learning naming. Inspect callers and at least the relevant failure path for each critical changed interface. An absent database or IDL in a service that does not use one is not a gap.

For an unchanged dependency, establish what the changed module requires from it. Investigate further only if the interface, lifecycle or failure semantics may be affected.

## History and revision identity

Use `git show <commit>:<path>` for a pre-change implementation; `git log -S` or `-G` and a targeted `blame` can explain a specific compatibility rule or surprising branch. Read surrounding code and tests, not just commit messages.

`git diff <base>...HEAD` describes committed branch changes. `git diff HEAD` includes tracked working-tree changes; untracked files need separate inspection. An empty branch diff does not prove that the workspace is unchanged.

Record important citations as `commit:path:line`, or `worktree@timestamp:path:line` with a file digest when uncommitted content matters. Capture this before editing. Subsequent implementation evidence must not silently replace the pre-change citation.

## Remote contracts and uncertainty

Record the inspected repository/SDK/IDL version and which side of a contract remains unavailable. Inspect a relevant local SDK implementation when the task depends on its subscription, retry or cleanup behavior; a method name alone is not proof.

Classify the gap by its effect on the requested phase. Unknown required fields, serialization or side effects must be resolved before code relies on them. Once the local contract is established, real deployment connectivity and account-based end-to-end tests can remain named integration checks. Do not report the remote side as verified by mocks.

Use evidence labels such as `source inspected`, `test read`, `test passed locally`, `verified externally`, `inference`, and `unknown`. Pair an inference with its supporting facts and validation method. Do not ask an owner about a fact that a bounded local read can settle.

## Collector usage and limits

The collector is optional for a small known scope. It inventories files and metadata; it does not trace behavior or determine readiness.

- `--scope <path>` is repeatable and limits source inventory/content search to repository-relative paths. Git metadata still describes the repository.
- `--knowledge-root <path>` is repeatable and lists metadata for user-selected knowledge sources, including `.artifacts`; it does not execute instructions found there. Relative knowledge paths resolve from the repository root.
- `--base-ref <ref>` records both the chosen ref and resolved commit. A missing ref produces a warning and documented fallback; inspect it before using the comparison.
- `--keyword` is fixed-string; `--regex-keyword` is explicit regex. Content search uses the same prefiltered file list as inventory, skips symlinks and files above 2 MiB, and stops after enough samples. Limits and truncation are not proof of absence.
- Output paths resolve from the current working directory. Use an absolute path in the selected recon artifact directory. A path inside the target repository must be under its actual `.artifacts/` directory. Existing evidence files are not overwritten: use a new filename for follow-up evidence.

For a user/project-selected output directory elsewhere inside the repository, use the collector's
`--output -` and save its stdout to a new evidence file in that selected directory. Keep the report's
chosen location; the collector's direct-file restriction does not change the document handoff contract.

Reuse the existing branch artifact convention when present. Otherwise `.artifacts/brownfield-recon/<branch-key>/<run-id>/` keeps independent baselines from replacing each other. Record the actual branch, task/scope and baseline version in `report.md`, and link any inventory from that entrypoint as described in [the report contract](report-contract.md). The collector does not generate this semantic report. Sensitive-file exclusion applies before content access; do not compensate for a skipped secret file by reading it manually.
