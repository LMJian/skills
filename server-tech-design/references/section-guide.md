# Section Guide — Select Concerns, Then Organize the Design

Use this as an internal coverage guide when choosing or reviewing sections. A concern may be handled
inside a flow, contract, or rollout explanation; it does not automatically deserve a chapter.
Follow an explicitly required user or project template. Otherwise omit inapplicable concerns without
filling the document with “N/A” or explanations of deleted headings.

## Build the reading path

A useful starting path is **problem and scope → solution overview → how it works → verification and
rollout**. Name the detailed sections after the actual design questions. Keep a section only if it has
an independent purpose; place a failure rule beside the step that can fail, then reference it elsewhere.

Before drafting the outline, walk a representative scenario from input to result. Include relevant
lifecycle transitions, such as creation, update, deletion, or rollback. Confirm the sources of inputs,
ownership of state, selection rules, and externally observable results. Do not assume a component or
configuration exists simply because the flow needs one.

## Engineering coverage — apply where relevant

| Concern | Questions to resolve | When to expand |
|---|---|---|
| Background and scope | What happens today, what problem changes, and what outcome demonstrates success? | Explain unfamiliar context; omit project history that does not explain a decision. |
| Core decisions | What is chosen, why, and what important trade-off is accepted? | Compare real alternatives when their cost, correctness, or compatibility differs materially. |
| Interfaces and contracts | Who calls what, with which inputs and outputs? What validates, authenticates, authorizes, or deduplicates the request? | New or changed contracts, consumer changes, sensitive data, or non-obvious limits. |
| Data, configuration, and cache | Where does each value come from, who owns it, and how is it discovered, identified, stored, updated, or removed? | New state, persistence or consistency behavior, dynamic discovery, or migration. |
| Failures and resource bounds | What fails, what does the caller observe, and what continues serving? What bounds time, size, retries, and concurrency? | Consequential failure paths and dependency behavior; refer back to shared rules. |
| Security and privacy | What changes in trust, authorization, tenant isolation, data exposure, or outbound access? | A changed security boundary or an applicable organizational requirement. |
| Compatibility | Which old callers, data, configurations, or versions must keep working? How do they coexist or migrate? | Behavior or contract changes; explain transitions instead of saying “compatible.” |
| Capacity and performance | What new traffic, storage, I/O, fan-out, or resource pressure does the change create? | Material cost or latency changes; show assumptions and the bottleneck. |
| Multiple regions and deployment variants | Are routing, locality, cross-region failures, private deployments, or older deployments relevant? | The actual dependency path crosses these boundaries. |
| Monitoring | What proves the system is available, correct enough for its intended use, and operating within budget? | Use the metric guidance below; expand only the important diagnostic dimensions. |
| Verification and rollout | How will the critical behavior be checked, enabled, monitored, stopped, and restored? | New behavior or deployment risk; state dependency order and rollback prerequisites. |

## Sources of truth and terminology

Explain related concepts together when they can be confused: configuration identity versus publication
revision, desired state versus usable state, or loading a capability versus selecting it for traffic.
Show what each controls and how they relate, using a small example if helpful.

For a field, identify whether it is supplied by the caller, inherited from environment or connection
context, derived from a key, or explicitly configured. Repeated representations of the same fact need
an owner and a consistency rule; add a redundant field only when its validation or operational purpose
justifies the extra state.

Keep the exact contract accessible. Put a schema or compact contract description before detailed
examples. Use either annotated fields or a field reference as the primary explanation; examples should
illustrate behavior rather than duplicate the reference. Identify examples that are incomplete or untested.

## Monitoring: define metrics and their meaning

Start with the operations whose failure matters. Use counters for requests, completions, and failures,
histograms for latency, and gauges for meaningful current state. Rates and percentiles should be derived
from those measurements. Distinguish attempted, completed, and retried work when they have different counts.

| Monitoring object | Measurements or reused metrics | Interpretation and dimensions | Alert condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| An operation or interface | Volume, failures, duration | Define success, failure classes, and the bounded dimensions needed to locate the problem. | Select the actionable availability, error, or latency condition. |
| A relevant background process or state | Attempts, failures, duration, or readiness | Explain whether failure affects current service or only a pending update. | Persistent failure or loss of required usable state. |

Adapt these rows; not every design has a background loader. Platform metrics can be reused when they
cover the required signal. Avoid duplicate instrumentation, but still identify the interface availability,
latency, and throughput that the design relies on. Give metric names or their definition; identify
proposed additions and existing sources without claiming planned instrumentation is already deployed.

For layered protocols, distinguish transport success from operation success. For example, a protocol
error can occur inside HTTP 200. Define the denominator, timeout and cancellation treatment, and caller
versus service failures when they affect the success or availability measure. Do not sum the same request
across layers. State how probes or ingress metrics cover no-traffic periods or failures invisible to the
application when availability requires that coverage.

Use bounded labels; keep request IDs, raw errors, credentials, and user content out of metric labels.
Use logs and traces for correlation and detailed diagnostic metadata without recording sensitive payloads.
Keep test plans and release TODOs outside the monitoring explanation. Set thresholds from a stated target
or observed baseline rather than inventing a production limit.

## Verification, rollout, and organizational requirements

At design time, identify acceptance scenarios for the core flow and the significant failure, security,
and compatibility boundaries. Link executed results only when available; distinguish a planned test,
a local or mocked check, and a production validation.

For changes that need staged release, explain enablement, observation, abort conditions, and rollback.
Use the applicable control mechanism, such as an existing feature gate, route, or configuration revision;
name an FG specifically when the verified project policy or design requires it. Show what the control
actually stops or restores, including existing requests or connections and irreversible data changes.

Apply organizational requirements using their current source and scope. Region-hop budgets, capacity
sign-off thresholds, link-level rules, mandatory FG controls, security conclusions, and review procedures
are not universal constants. Confirm relevant policy and cite it; mark an unresolved requirement only
when it materially affects this design. Keep measured numbers, estimates, and proposed limits distinct.

Add owner, reviewers, milestones, test links, and review records when known or required for this delivery.
Do not imply review approval, test completion, capacity sign-off, or rollout readiness through a filled template.
